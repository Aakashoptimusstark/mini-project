Description:
<br>
Created an interactive mini cricket-themed game inspired by rock-paper-scissors logic, where the player competes against the computer's random choices. The user selects one of three options — Bat, Ball, or Stump — and the computer simultaneously makes a random choice. The winner is determined based on predefined rules:
<br>
•	Bat beats Ball
<br>
•	Ball beats Stump
<br>
•	Stump beats Bat
<br>
Implemented game logic using conditional statements and JavaScript event handling. Designed a responsive and visually engaging UI with real-time result updates, score tracking, and reset functionality.
